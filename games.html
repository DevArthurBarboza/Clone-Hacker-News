    <h1> Video Games</h1>
    <h2> In My Life</h2>
    <p> Videogames in my childhood were my most prefered hobby, when I was 6 years
        old I got a ps2 and when I was 9 years old I got a xbox360. I didn't
        have any friends so my videogames were my best friends for most of the time
    </p>
