        <p> In the beggining of my studies I was just making a lot of mess but 
            now I'm starting to be more organized and using semantic tags. 
            I hope that acording with the 
            <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/html5-and-css-fundamentals" 
            target=_blank>course</a>, I start to
            make websites more elaborate and prettier, maybe start working in 
            this area and grow up as a <span id = "frontdeveloper">
            front-end developer.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            One thing that I enjoy learning is Java, is very complex and 
            everything makes sense, I'm thinking very much about studing 
            deep Java to work with it and apply in many projects and technology
        </p>
        <p>
            Another thing that I'm very interested is learn about the maintenance
            and cleaning of hardware, understand how works the fisical connection 
            between them, pattern of cables, frequencys, models and
